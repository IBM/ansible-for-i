  # download information into the download_status table and part of the PTF group information into the ptf_group_image_info table in the PTF database.

# Parameters:
  # repo_server -- The IBM i server which can use SNDPTFORD to download and store PTF and PTF group install files.  
  # ptf_group -- The PTF group number which will be checked and downloaded.

# Command example: 
  # ansible-playbook ./check_download_ptf_group.yml -e "{'repo_server': 'reposerver', 'ptf_group': 'SF99663'}"
