module: ibmi_fetch
short_description: Fetch objects or a library from a remote IBM i node and store on local
version_added: '1.0.0'
description:
     - The C(ibmi_feth) is used for fetching objects or a library as a SAVF from remote IBM i node and storing them locally in
       a file tree, organized by hostname.
     - Save file that already exists at dest will be overwritten if it is different than the new one.
     - For non-IBMi native targets, use the fetch module instead.
options:
  object_names:
    description:
      - The objects need to be fetched.
      - One or more object names can be specified. Use space as separator.
      - If object type is C(*FILE), then fetch it directly. Only one C(*FILE) object will fetch directly at one time.
    type: str
    default: '*ALL'
  lib_name:
    description:
      - The library contains the objects.
        If is_lib is C(True), lib_name means the library name.
    type: str
    required: yes
  object_types:
    description:
      - The object types.
      - One or more object types can be specified. Use space as separator.
    type: str
    default: '*ALL'
  savefile_name:
    description:
      - The save file name can be specified.
      - If not specified savefile_name, the save file name will be the first object_name.file. If is_lib is True, the save file
        name will be lib_name.file.
        For example, if fetch obja.pgm and objb.srvpgm in objlib library, the save file name will be obja.
        If the obja already exists in objlib, then rename the save file name to (obja+number), number range from
        1 to 9(obja1, obja2...obja9).
    type: str
    default: ''
  is_lib:
    description:
      - If it is a library needed to be fetched.
        If set True, the whole library will be fetched.
    type: bool
    default: False
  dest:
    description:
      - A local directory to save the file into.
      - For example, if the dest directory is /backup save file named /qsys.lib/objlib.lib/test1.file on host host.example.com,
        would be saved into /backup/host.example.com/qsys.lib/objlib.lib/test1.file.
        The host name is based on the inventory name.
        If dest='', dest will be current directory.
    type: str
    required: yes
  force_save:
    description:
      - If force to use savefile_name when savefile_name.file already exists on remote IBM i.
    type: bool
    default: False
  backup:
    description:
      - If delete the save file on remote IBM i or not. If set True, the save file on remote IBM i will not be deleted.
    type: bool
    default: False
  format:
    description:
      - The save file's format. Only support C(*SAVF) by now.
    type: str
    default: '*SAVF'
    choices: ["*SAVF"]
  target_release:
    description:
      - The release of the operating system on which you intend to restore and use the SAVF.
    type: str
    default: '*CURRENT'
  validate_checksum:
    description:
      - Verify that the source and destination checksums match after the files are fetched.
    type: bool
    default: True
  flat:
    description:
      - Allows you to override the default behavior of appending hostname/path/to/file to the destination.
      - This can be useful if working with a single host, or if retrieving files that are uniquely named per host.
      - If using multiple hosts with the same filename, the file will be overwritten for each host.
    type: bool
    default: False

notes:
    - ansible.cfg needs to specify interpreter_python=/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/python3 under[defaults] section
    - Need install 5770SS1 option 39 on remote IBM i for regex usage
