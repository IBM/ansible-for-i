module: ibmi_synchronize
short_description: Synchronize a save file from IBM i node A to another IBM i node B
version_added: '1.0.0'
description:
     - The C(ibmi_synchronize) plugin synchronize a save file from IBM i node A to another IBM i node B.
     - C(ibmi_synchronize) plugin calls ibmi_sync module.
     - Only support to synchronize save file by now.
     - For non-IBMi native targets, use the synchronize module instead.
     - delegate_to must be set to IBM i node A, and set hosts to IBM i node B.
     - Be careful to set delegate_to or hosts to node groups. The synchronized data may be overridden.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - Save file path on the source host that will be synchronized to the destination.
      - The path must be absolute. For example, /qsys.lib/test.lib/c1.file.
    type: str
    required: yes
  dest:
    description:
      - Path on the destination host that will be synchronized from the source.
      - The path must be absolute, and dest must be a IBM i native library. For example, /qsys.lib/test.lib.
      - If not specify, dest will be equal to src.
    type: str
    default: ''
  remote_user:
    description:
      - The user name to connect to the remote IBM i node B.
      - If not specify, remote_user will be the ansible_ssh_user of IBM i node B, which stored in ansible inventory.
    type: str
    default: ''
  private_key:
    description:
      - Specifies SSH private key path on IBM i node A used to connect to remote IBM i node B.
      - The path can be absolute or relative.
    type: str
    default: '~/.ssh/id_rsa'

notes:
    - ansible.cfg needs to specify interpreter_python=/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/python3 under [defaults] section.
    - delegate_to must be set to IBM i node A.
    - Make sure ssh passwordless login works from IBM i node A to IBM i node B.
    - private_key must be a rsa key in the legacy PEM private key format.
    - Doesn't support IASP by now.
